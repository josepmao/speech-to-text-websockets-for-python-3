speech-to-text-websockets-python updated to python 3 

Adapted from https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/speech-to-text-websockets-python 

This project consists of a python client that interacts with the IBM Watson Speech To Text service through its WebSockets interface. The client streams audio to the STT service and receives recognition hypotheses in real time. 
It can run N simultaneous recognition sessions. 

**The original sample connection script provided by the Watson team only worked in Python 2. This simply updates that script for Python 3. No other changes were made.**
